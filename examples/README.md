# Cucumber Anti-Pattern Examples

This directory contains examples of common Cucumber anti-patterns that candidates should learn to identify and avoid during the interview process.

## 🎯 Purpose

These examples are designed to help candidates:
- Recognize common anti-patterns in BDD/Cucumber implementations
- Understand the difference between good and bad practices
- Learn how to write maintainable, reusable automation code

## 📁 Directory Structure

## 🚫 Common Anti-Patterns Demonstrated

### 1. **Feature-Coupled Step Definitions**
- **Problem**: Step files named after specific features (e.g., `profile_management_steps.ts`)
- **Solution**: Name files after domain concepts (e.g., `user_steps.ts`, `authentication_steps.ts`)

### 2. **Conjunction Steps**
- **Problem**: Single steps that do multiple things ("When I update my name and email and phone")
- **Solution**: Break into atomic, single-purpose steps

### 3. **UI-Coupled Steps**
- **Problem**: Steps that reference visual/layout details ("click the blue button in the top navigation")
- **Solution**: Focus on behavior, use semantic selectors (data-testid)

### 4. **Imperative vs Declarative**
- **Problem**: Steps describing HOW ("click field, clear it, type value")
- **Solution**: Steps describing WHAT ("I update my name to 'John'")

### 5. **Excessive Implementation Details**
- **Problem**: Business scenarios mentioning technical details ("DOM contains", "network requests")
- **Solution**: Keep scenarios business-focused, hide technical details in step implementations

## 🛠️ How to Use These Examples

### For Candidates:
1. **Review the bad examples** - Try to identify the anti-patterns
2. **Compare with good examples** - See the improved approach
3. **Run the anti-pattern checker**: `node anti-pattern-checker.js`
4. **Practice refactoring** - Take a bad example and improve it

### For Interviewers:
1. **Code Review Exercise** - Ask candidates to identify issues in bad examples
2. **Refactoring Challenge** - Have candidates improve the anti-patterns
3. **Discussion Points** - Use examples to discuss best practices

## 🔍 Anti-Pattern Detection

Run the automated checker to find anti-patterns:

```bash
node anti-pattern-checker.js
```

The checker will scan all feature files and step definitions for:
- Feature-coupled naming
- Conjunction steps
- UI-coupled language
- Imperative phrasing
- Excessive technical details

## 📚 Key Learning Points

### ✅ Good Practices
- **Reusable steps** that work across multiple features
- **Atomic steps** that do one thing well
- **Business language** in feature files
- **Domain-focused** organization
- **Declarative scenarios** focusing on outcomes

### ❌ Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- **Feature-specific** step definitions
- **Conjunction steps** combining multiple actions
- **UI implementation details** in scenarios
- **Imperative instructions** about HOW to do something
- **Technical jargon** in business scenarios

## 🎓 Interview Discussion Topics

These examples can spark discussions about:
- **Maintainability** - How anti-patterns increase maintenance costs
- **Reusability** - Why domain-focused steps are more reusable
- **Readability** - How business stakeholders should understand scenarios
- **Test Pyramid** - Where UI automation fits in testing strategy
- **Collaboration** - How BDD facilitates team communication

💡 **Pro Tip**: The best way to learn is by doing! Try refactoring the bad examples into good ones, then run the anti-pattern checker to verify your improvements.
